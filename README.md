Documentation for setting up Cardano Genesis node (Jormungandr)

At the moment Shelley testnet is in its early stages. To be honest I found the documentation for creating a jormungandr staking pool incomplete and difficult to follow. Obviously the guys who created it did so over a period of time, and had a computer with all sorts of softweare installed which allowed it to work. I felt we needed a step by step guide which could start with nothing and, following the commands, would end up with a running staking node.

Hey, I have a running staking node, all I have to do is tell you what I did.

Erm, ok, it turned out harder than that. All the tiral and error that goes on means you sort of forget all the steps. However, to cut a long story short, I have created this fabulous step by step guide. Collected from generally around the place and pasted into a story.

Enjoy.
